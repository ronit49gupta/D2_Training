// Coding Exercise 4: Building a First Component

// 1. Practice what you learned about components and build a new React component on your own!
// 2. Your task is to build a custom <ExerciseComponent /> that outputs the text 
//    "First exercise - done!" on the screen.
// 3. Use the empty ExerciseComponent.js file for your new component code 
// and output this component inside the already existing App component.
import React from "react";

function ExerciseComponent(){
    return <h1>First exercise - done!</h1>
}

export default ExerciseComponent;
